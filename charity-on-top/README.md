#Inspiration
Many individuals within every community are often passionate about a certain cause, but many fail to act upon that 
passion due to a lack of motivation. My team and I found this especially troubling when we realized the multitude of simple ways
that people could contribute. Of those consisted of local businesses that partner up with charities to create "charity deals", 
or a product or service, that upon purchase, will allow the business to donate a certain portion of proceeds to their partnering
charity. Charity deals often allow the individual to support a cause without directly spending extra money or time to do so. 

#What it does
Our application, "Charity On Top", helps connect individuals with local businesses that offer charity deals. "Charity On Top" 
tracks the individual's location and helps locate nearby do-good businesses around them. Individuals can also look up businesses 
based on the product or service they are looking for, or look up a certain cause that they are particularly passionate about, and
the application will provide them with nearby businesses that provide said services or products, or are partnered with said 
charities.
