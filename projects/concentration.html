      <h1>Receipt Nation: Commercialism as a Unifying Force</h1>
      <p>
        My concentration topic is commercialism as a unifying force. Even without using them, I grew up with and recognized the brands of household goods which line the shelves of American supermarkets. Coming from an immigrant background, this experience allowed me to feel closer to my peers; the physical landscape of common brands shaped my perceptions of foreign and domestic.
        When our languages and cultures differ, how interesting it is that we share these routines and find familiarity in them! In divisive times, commercialism is another way for people to be united as Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        My artwork showcases the interactions between the diversity in the United States and the American products. Much like conventional advertising, my pieces incorporate smiling faces and bright packaging to convey a sense of vibrancy, but juxtaposes the division of identities with a focus on what people have in common: a need for food, hygiene, and health. For the majority of the pieces, I chose the primary focus to be a collaged character, an energetic figure created with body parts showcasing a variety of ages, cultures, physical features, and lifestyle choices. For example, piece 9 incorporates both a woman wearing a hijab and the arm of an older man wearing a polo, while piece 4 shows a hand composed of features of hands tattooed, wrinkled, or painted with nail polish. As I moved forward, I also wished to discuss place and physical unity. Piece 7 demonstrates the action of going to supermarkets as one which brings people together, while piece 8 discusses differences in socioeconomic statuses by demonstrating the variety in ways people get to the supermarket : car, walking, public transportation, or horse and buggy. Iâ€™d like these interactions to convey a sense of unity and optimism, while sparking further questions about what it means to live in the United States and shedding light on new perceptions regarding commercialism.
